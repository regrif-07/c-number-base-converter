# c-number-base-converter

This project was created just to get a hang of the C programming language during a university course.

A simple console UI is provided - system of menus, where you can choose between "decimal to base" and "base to decimal" conversions.

This project will not be updated as I see it as complete.

P.S. This repo lacks issues and some branches because it was initially hosted on another service.
